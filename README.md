:newspaper: Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahemateja19bec1025/traffic-sign-dataset-classification

:heavy_check_mark: How to run:

I used google Collab notebook to write the code and some notes.
Next to each code cell, there is a "Run" button, or "Run All" at the top.
I used as a validation set, the same images as I did for tests just to see other results.

## Let's jump a bit of theory

What is a Conv2D Layer?

"This layer creates a convolution kernel that is convolved with the layer input over a 2D spatial (or temporal) dimension (height and width) to produce a tensor of outputs."

What is a MaxPooling2D Layer?

"Downsamples the input along its spatial dimensions (height and width) by taking the maximum value over an input window (of size defined by pool_size) for each channel of the input. The window is shifted by strides along each dimension."

ADAM Optimizer:

"Adam optimization is a stochastic gradient descent method that is based on adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments."
