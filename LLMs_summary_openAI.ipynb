In the two millennia since,\\nChristianity\\nhas spread across the world, becoming the\\nworld\\'s largest religion\\nwith\\nover two billion adherents worldwide\\n.\\nInitially, Christianity was a mostly urban\\ngrassroots\\nmovement. Its\\nreligious text\\nwas written in the first century. A formal church government developed, and it grew to over a million adherents by the third century.\\nConstantine the Great\\nissued the\\nEdict of Milan\\nlegalizing it in 315.\\nChristian art, architecture\\n, and\\nliterature\\nblossomed during the fourth century, but competing theological doctrines led to\\ndivisions\\n. The\\nNicene Creed\\nof 325, the\\nNestorian schism\\n, the\\nChurch of the East\\nand\\nOriental Orthodoxy\\nresulted. While the\\nWestern Roman Empire\\nended in 476, its successor states and its eastern compatriot—the\\nByzantine Empire\\n—remained Christian.\\nAfter the fall of Rome in 476, western monks preserved culture and provided social services.\\nEarly Muslim conquests\\ndevastated many Christian communities in the\\nMiddle East and North Africa\\n, but\\nChristianization\\ncontinued in Europe and Asia and helped form the states of\\nEastern Europe\\n. The 1054\\nEast–West Schism\\nsaw the Byzantine Empire\\'s\\nEastern Orthodoxy\\nand Western Europe\\'s\\nCatholic Church\\nseparate. In spite of differences, the East requested western military aid against the Turks, resulting in the\\nCrusades\\n.\\nGregorian reform\\nled to a more centralized and bureaucratic\\nCatholicism\\n. Faced with internal and external challenges, the church fought\\nheresy\\nand established courts of\\ninquisition\\n. Artistic and\\nintellectual advances\\namong western monks played a part in the\\nRenaissance\\nand the later\\nScientific Revolution\\n.\\nIn the 14th century, the\\nWestern Schism\\nand\\nseveral European crises\\nled to the 16th-century\\nReformation\\nwhen\\nProtestantism\\nformed. Reformation Protestants advocated for\\nreligious tolerance\\nand the\\nseparation of church and state\\nand impacted economics. Quarrelling royal houses took sides precipitating the\\nEuropean wars of religion\\n. Christianity spread with the\\ncolonization\\nof the\\nAmericas\\n,\\nAustralia\\n, and\\nNew Zealand\\n. Different parts of Christianity influenced the\\nAge of Enlightenment\\n,\\nAmerican\\nand\\nFrench Revolutions\\n, the\\nIndustrial Revolution\\n, and the\\nAtlantic slave trade\\n. Some Protestants created\\nbiblical criticism\\nwhile others responded to\\nrationalism\\nwith\\nPietism\\nand religious revivals that created new\\ndenominations\\n. Nineteenth century missionaries laid the linguistic and cultural foundation for many nations.\\nIn the twentieth century\\n, Christianity declined in most of the Western world but grew in the\\nGlobal South\\n, particularly\\nSoutheast Asia\\nand\\nSub-Saharan Africa\\n.
